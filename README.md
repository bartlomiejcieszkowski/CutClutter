This is a simple program created to help with a problem of unsegragated files.

Let's say you have 500 pictures, and half of them are cats, rest are memes, and you want to segragate them into their respective folders.

Open preview and then move each 1 after another to a different folder?

This program helps with this.

How?

Basically it does it in a manner how we manually sort items (at least me) for example:
i have a pile of unsorted papers, and some I want to keep, and the rest throw out, so the steps are:
- place an unsorted pile in the middle
- go through the pile and let's say: on left put things to throw out, and on the right to keep
- continue until you reach an end of a said pile


Ok, but how does this apply to this program?

In the same manner:
 - select "source" - middle pile
 - select target folder for right & select target folder for left
 - and go through pile with Left Click where:
   * clicking on left side - moves file to left pile
   * clicking on right side - moves file to right pile
   * clicking on the middle - leaves file as it is and skips to next
   
By default it is in pictures mode - you can r-click on **`Select Source`** and change it to all files mode
